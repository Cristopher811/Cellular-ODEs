# CELLULAR ODE'S

## How to compile?

This program uses header files in order to improve efficiency, thus, be sure to be in the directory ./Project/, in there, write the next command: 

$ gcc ./Sources/rhs_n.c main.c -o main.out

And then execute the output with

$ ./main.out

Remember to change the __n__ in rhs_n depending of the cell you want to model.
